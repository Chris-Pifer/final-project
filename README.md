# final-project

Project summary:

  This project will start with the assignment on linked lists and extend its functionality. The goal is to include a multitude of different sorting methods. We are aiming to add two or more different sorting algorithms for two or more primitive data types. For example, bubble sorting strings alphabetically could be one of the sorting features added. To assist in the implementation of the sorting methods we will also add addititional accessibility methods, such as get element by position in the list, find length of list, and switching specified elements.
