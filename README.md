# final-project

Project summary:

  This project will start with the assignment on linked lists and extend its functionality. The goal is to include a multitude of different sorting methods. We are aiming to implement sorting algorithms for two or more primitive data types. For example, bubble sorting strings alphabetically could be one of the sorting features added. To assist in the implementation of the sorting methods we will also add addititional accessibility methods, such as get element by position in the list, find length of list, and switching specified elements.
  
How to run:

  Personally i recommend you download the pre-built .exe file and just run it, as build settings for multi file projects can be finicky if you're unfamiliar with them (like me). The old functions from assignment 4 have been temporarily disabled so you don't have to mess with text files and file paths. Also they aren't really relevant to the new stuff.
  
  However, if you want to build the project yourself, the 3 files you need are here on github: main.cpp, class.cpp, and Final.h. To build these you would need to make a new project, add these files, and then make sure all the linking and target destination settings were correct for using multiple files and headers.

Dependencies:
  Currently none.

System requirements:
  A toaster could probably run this.
